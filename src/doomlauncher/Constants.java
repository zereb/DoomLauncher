When this is enabled, the \"raise platform by lower texture\" line special and MAP07 floor raise considers AASHITTY or AASTINKY as a valid texture and uses it's height when raising a platform. If disabled, these textures aren't considered valid and are ignored.",
         "Causes doom to calculate heights of stairs when stairbuilding from the last (topmost) step, instead of the first (bottom-most) step.",
         "Prevents pain elementals from spawning lost souls if there are 20 or more on the map.",
         "This prevents players from hearing other players picking up items, weapons, or powerups in netgames.",

         "Forces all actors to play all sounds only on one channel, cutting off any previous sounds the actor has made. Only enable this if you can't live without the silent BFG trick, as it will cripple the sound system and prevent actors from playing any more than one sound at a time.",
         "This uses a buggier method of collision detection with walls that allows a player to run double average speed when pressing against a vertically-aligned wall.",
